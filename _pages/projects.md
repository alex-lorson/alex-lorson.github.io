## Making the Invisible Visible

I contributed with my art to [Dr Mirjam Eiswirth]( https://mirjameiswirth.wordpress.com)'s exhibition [Making the Invisible Visible]( https://mirjameiswirth.wordpress.com/making-the-invisible-visible/). The exhibition „Makes the Invisible Visible“ by showing the diversity of people who live with Type 1 Diabetes. [Dr Alpo Honkapohja]( https://www.ed.ac.uk/profile/alpo-honkapohja) created 16 portraits and I created 10 comic strips showing the impact Type 1 Diabetes has on many aspects of day-to-day life, like work, relationships, emotions, and being physically active. Check out Mirjams website to see more about her wonderful project and exhibition dates. Below, one of my comics showing different symptoms of people when their blood sugar gets too low.

## Art reproductions

Once in a while I help people to digitalise their art. This means I reproduce their art as a vector graphic which makes them high resolution and reproducable. I have recently finished an art re-production for the family of a late artist.
