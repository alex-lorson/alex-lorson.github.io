Hi, my name is Alex and I am a Linguistics PhD student at the School of Philosophy, Psychology and Language Sciences at the University of Edinburgh. I work in the area of experimental pragmatics and my PhD project revolves around presuppositions, supervised by Hannah Rohde and Chris Cummins. More specifically, I investigate how interlocutors organise dialogue by focusing on the presupposition-assertion distinction.

From a speaker’s point of view, I would like to know how speakers structure their utterances --- given that they can choose to either presuppose or assert information --- and how their choice influences what content bits are picked up in the subsequent dialogue.

From a hearer’s point of view, I would like to know how hearers infer whether a speaker presupposed information or not and what factors play a role in this inference process.
