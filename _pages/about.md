Hi, my name is Alex and I am a postdoctoral research fellow on the `Making Numbers Meaningful’ project lead by [Bodo Winter](https://bodowinter.com/) at [the University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx).  

I am doing research in the field of experimental Pragmatics, and I am interested in strategic communication; for example, I focus on how speakers’ formulation choices change depending on the communicative goals they pursue.

I did my PhD in Linguistics at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). In my PhD project, which was supervised by [Hannah Rohde](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/index.html) and [Chris Cummins](http://www.crcummins.com/), I focused on the role of presuppositions in structuring dialogue. In my thesis I looked at how speakers structure their utterances --- given that they can choose to either presuppose or assert information --- and how their choice influences what content bits are picked up in the subsequent dialogue. Similarly, I investigated how hearers infer whether a speaker presupposes information or not and what factors play a role in this inference process.


In my freetime, I love to [sketch](https://www.instagram.com/lordysart/) :)
