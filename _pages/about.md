Hi, my name is Alex and I am a Linguistics PhD student at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I work in the area of experimental pragmatics and I'm interested in how interlocutors organise dialogue by using different linguistic tools to background and foreground the points they are making. In my PhD project, which is supervised by [Hannah Rohde](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/index.html) and [Chris Cummins](http://www.crcummins.com/), I focus on the role of presuppositions in structuring dialogue.

More specifically, I'm looking at how speakers structure their utterances --- given that they can choose to either presuppose or assert information --- and how their choice influences what content bits are picked up in the subsequent dialogue. Similarly, I would like to know how hearers infer whether a speaker presupposes information or not and what factors play a role in this inference process.

In my freetime I love to [sketch](https://www.instagram.com/lordysart/) :)!
