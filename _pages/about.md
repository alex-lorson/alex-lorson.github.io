Hi, my name is Alex and I am an assistant professor at the Faculty of Arts of [the University of Groningen](https://www.rug.nl/) where I am part of the [Semantics and Cognition Group](https://semcog.nl/) headed by [Petra Hendriks](http://www.let.rug.nl/~hendriks/personal/index.html). My research is situated in the field of experimental Pragmatics and I am interested in strategic communication. For example, I focus on how speakers’ formulation choices change depend on the communicative goals they pursue. 

Previously, I was a postdoctoral research fellow on the `Making Numbers Meaningful’ project led by [Bodo Winter](https://bodowinter.com/) at [the University of Birmingham](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/index.aspx). I did my PhD in Linguistics at [the University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/) supervised by [Hannah Rohde](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/index.html) and [Chris Cummins](http://www.crcummins.com/).


In my freetime, I love to [sketch](https://www.instagram.com/lordysart/) :)
