Hi, my name is Alex and I am a Linguistics PhD student at the [University of Edinburgh](https://www.ed.ac.uk/). I work in the area of experimental pragmatics and my PhD project revolves around presuppositions, supervised by [Hannah Rohde](http://www.lel.ed.ac.uk/~hrohde/index.html) and [Chris Cummins](http://www.crcummins.com/). More specifically, I investigate how interlocutors organise dialogue by focusing on the presupposition-assertion distinction.

From a speaker’s point of view, I would like to know how speakers structure their utterances --- given that they can choose to either presuppose or assert information --- and how their choice influences what content bits are picked up in the subsequent dialogue.

From a hearer’s point of view, I would like to know how hearers infer whether a speaker presupposed information or not and what factors play a role in this inference process.
